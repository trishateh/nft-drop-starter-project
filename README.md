# Solana NFT Drop Project

This is a web app on Solana built with Metaplex that lets users connect their wallet, click mint, and receive a one of a kind NFT from my handcrafted collection ("Big Nose Fluffs Solana Season #1 NFT Collection") in their wallet. 

Why "Big Nose Fluffs" ? Because animals with big noses are really adorable!

Still don't believe me? :)
